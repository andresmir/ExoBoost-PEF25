# ExoBoost-PEF25
Control System and Digital Twin in Lower-Limb Exoskeleton for Assisted Movement

The repository contains all the files and contents that were developed during out thesis semester. Within the files, developers can find the development of an advance emebedded ESP32 system based on FreeRTOS. FreeRTOS is a Real-Time Operating System that allowed us to fully levarge all the capabilities of the ESP32 device by utilizing its dual-core architecture. The embedded system was developed using the PlatformIO extension in VSCode. 

Additionally, developers can find the design of a digital platform capable of wirelessly aquiring data and visualizing the exoskeleton's movements through a digital twin of the exoskeleton. Through the use of this platform, developers and end-users can easily configure the exoskeleton assitive/resistive modes, thus creating a complex and easy to use digital tool for interfacing with the exoskeleton.
